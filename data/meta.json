Since the value of \u00af\u03b8is e\ufb00ectively arbitrary, one is left with a\nsevere \ufb01ne tuning problem.\nThe elegant solution of Peccei and Quinn1is to allow \u03b8to become a dy-\nnamical \ufb01eld which relaxes toward the CP conserving value \u00af\u03b8= 0a, by the\nspontaneous breaking of a U(1)-symmetry.
